# Welcome to GitHub Desktop!

This is your README. READMEs are where you can communicate what your project is and how to use it.

Write your name on line 6, save it, and then head back to GitHub Desktop.

My name is Cooper Correa, I am a junior in Biosystems Engineering, and I think that GitHub Desktop is the most valuable version of GitHub because of these ease of being able to switch between code writing applications and saving changes.
